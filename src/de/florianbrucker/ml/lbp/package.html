Classes for texture classification using local binary patterns.
<p>
This package implements the algorithms described in the article
 <br><br>
 <i>Ojala, Pietik채inen, M채enp채채: "Multiresolution Gray-Scale and Rotation Invariant
 Texture Classification with Local Binary Patterns", IEEE Transactions on Pattern
 Analysis and Machine Intelligence, Vol. 24, No. 7, July 2002</i>
 <p>
 Please refer to the documentation of {@link LBPModel} for a description of how
 to use these classes. A simple demo implementation of a classification application
 is given by {@link LBPDemo}.
 <p>
 Note that this implementation differs in some aspects from the original approach
 of Ojala et al. See the documentation of {@link LBPModel} for further details.
